## Hello!  I'm Sheila Adams-Sapper

📊 Personal Projects Completed or In Process
- Deep Learning to explore factors in Parkinson Disease onset and progression
- RAG model: a small project to mine public data for gene variants and their reported pathogenic associated with Parkinson Disease
- Generative AI to explore functional characterization of microbial interactions
- Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) model to predict risk factors associated with Diabetes (GlucoTrack)
- Recursive Feature Engineering (RFE) and Random Forest models to predict UTI diagnosis (YootAssess)
- Functional python/streamlit app to help amateur radio operators practice with call sign phonetics (listening and speaking)

💼 Work Experience

- **Senior Bioinformatics Scientist** at Resilient Biotics (2018–Present)
  
  Primary focus: Biomarker discovery and validation for microbial-based therapeutic development
  - Developed RNA-seq, WGS, Sanger, and 16S microbiome analyses pipelines
  - Built Machine Learning models to discover patterns in complex sequencing data from field study biosamples
  - Developed a custom pipeline for risk analysis profiles of therapeutic candidates for antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and human pathogenicity

🌅 Fun facts: I love many areas of science.  I am a licensed amateur radio operator doing emergency communications and public service.  I love experimenting with homemade antennas which I use to explore radio communication propagation from parks and beaches.  I am a member of The Cello Collective in Sebastopol, California. (My dad made my cello!)
